Cupertino,_California



Cupertino ( ) is a city in Santa Clara County, California in the U.S., directly west of San Jose on the western edge of the Santa Clara Valley with portions extending into the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The population was 58,302 at the time of the 2010 census.  US Census 2000 Data for Cupertino, CAcensus.gov, Retrieved July 10, 2007  Forbes ranked it as one of the most educated small towns. It is best known as home to the worldwide headquarters of Apple Inc.



Cupertino was named after Arroyo San José de Cupertino (now Stevens Creek). The creek had been named by Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza's cartographer, who named it after Saint Joseph of Cupertino. Saint Joseph (born Giuseppe Maria Desa, and later known as Giuseppe da Copertino) was named after the town of Copertino in the Apulia region of Italy. The name Cupertino first became widely used when John T. Doyle, a San Francisco lawyer and historian, named his winery on McClellan Road "Cupertino". After the turn of the 20th century, Cupertino displaced the former name for the region, which was "West Side". Recently it tied up with Bhubaneswar in India as a sister city for mutual and co-lateral growth.



Cupertino in the 19th century was a small rural village at the crossroads of Stevens Creek Road and Saratoga-Mountain View Road (also known locally as Highway 9; later Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, and then renamed to De Anza Boulevard within Cupertino city limits). Back then, it was known as the West Side and was part of Fremont Township. The primary economic activity was fruit agriculture. Almost all of the land within Cupertino's present-day boundaries was covered by prune, plum, apricot, and cherry orchards. A winery on Montebello Ridge overlooking the Cupertino valley region was also operating by the late 19th century.

Soon railroads, electric railways, and dirt roads traversed the West Side farmlands. Monta Vista, Cupertino's first housing tract, was developed in the mid-20th century as a result of the electric railway's construction.

After World War II, a population and suburban housing boom dramatically shifted the demographics and economy of the Santa Clara Valley, as the "Valley of Heart's Delight" was beginning to transform into "Silicon Valley". In 1954, Cupertino leaders began to drive for incorporation as they were concerned about unplanned development and rising property taxes. In the September 27, 1955 election, voters approved the incorporation of the City of Cupertino. Cupertino officially became Santa Clara County's 13th City on October 10, 1955.

A major milestone in Cupertino's development was the creation by some of the city's largest landowners of VALLCO Business and Industrial Park in the early 1960s. Of the 25 property owners, 17 decided to pool their land to form VALLCO Park, 6 sold to Varian Associates (property later sold to Hewlett-Packard), and two opted for transplanting to farms elsewhere. The name VALLCO was derived from the names of the principal developers: Varian Associates and the Leonard, Lester, Craft, and Orlando families. A neighborhood outdoor shopping center and, much later, the enclosed Vallco Fashion Park, briefly renamed Cupertino Square, were also developed.

De Anza College opened in 1967. The college, named for Juan Bautista De Anza, occupies a   site that was the location of a winery built at the turn of the 20th century, called Beaulieu by its owners, Charles and Ella Baldwin. Their mansion has now become the California History Center. De Anza College now has about 22,000 students and is a hub of activity in the city. Its flea market, held the first Saturday of the month, attracts thousands from around the area.

Housing developments were rapidly constructed in the following years as developers created many neighborhoods, including Fairgrove, Garden Gate, Monta Vista, Seven Springs, and many other developments. Although originally low-cost housing, Silicon Valley's housing prices shot up dramatically as many houses that were formerly lowly priced became multi-million dollar homes. The high cost of living in Cupertino is attributed by people wanting their children to receive high-quality schooling. Nevertheless, the price of housing seems to have weathered even the 2007–8 slump in economy.

On December 1, 2009, Cupertino became the first city in Northern California to have an Asian-American-majority city council.

The headquarters of Apple Inc. on Infinite Loop in Cupertino.
Cupertino is one of many cities that claim to be the "heart" of Silicon Valley, as many semi-conductor and computer companies were founded here and in the surrounding areas.  The worldwide headquarters for Apple Inc. is also located here in a modern complex circled by the playfully named Infinite Loop. Apple has also announced that it plans to build a new   second campus between Interstate 280, N Wolfe Rd, E Homestead Rd and along Tantau Ave one mile east of the old campus. The different (nine) properties (  south of Pruneridge Avenue were bought in 2006, the property (  north of it in 2010 (from Hewlett-Packard). On June 7,
2011, a few months before his October 5 death from pancreatic cancer, Steve Jobs gave a presentation to Cupertino City Council, detailing the architectural design of the new building and its environs.  Steve Jobs Presents to Cupertino City Council  The new campus is planned to house up to 13,000 employees in one central four-storied circular building surrounded by extensive landscape (with parking mainly underground and the rest centralized in a parking structure).

Other companies headquartered in Cupertino include Trend Micro, Cloud.com, Lab126, Packeteer, Chordiant, and Seagate Technology. Over 60 high-tech companies have offices there, including IBM, Olivetti and Oracle. Most of these high-tech companies are located on De Anza Boulevard, Cali Mill Plaza, and Bubb Road.

Though Cupertino is home to the headquarters of many high-tech companies, very little manufacturing actually takes place in the city. The city's large office parks are primarily dedicated to management and design functions.

Winter morning at the farmers' market at Vallco Shopping Mall
Earlier in its history Cupertino attributed some of its city income from Vallco Fashion Park (see above), at the time one of the only major indoor shopping malls in the South Bay area. People from the greater South Bay area would come to spend money and contribute to the sales tax. Since then, several other shopping malls have sprung up; Valley Fair (now known as Westfield Valley Fair) in Santa Clara caters to the high end, expensive name brand boutique stores, while the Great Mall in Milpitas in the 1990s opened to the low-priced and bargain retailers. Vallco Fashion Park was hit hard by these developments, as well as the loss of one of its anchor stores, Emporium, and has had a hard time recovering ever since.

In 2002, Cupertino had a labor force of 25,780 with an unemployment rate of 4.5%. The unemployment rate for the Santa Clara County as a whole was 8.4%.

One of the major employers in the area is the aggregate rock quarry and cement plant in the foothills to the west of Cupertino. Currently owned and operated by Lehigh Southwest Cement, it was originally founded by Henry J. Kaiser as the Kaiser Permanente Cement Plant in 1939. Its somewhat novel charter was to provide the majority of the cement used in the construction of the Shasta Dam. It achieved this goal to with impressive results, supplying the   of cement over a dedicated nine mile (14 km)-long conveyor system.  Shasta Dam - Encyclopædia Britannica  The cement plant continues to be an important part of the local economy, and is the sole reason for the lone railroad line that runs through the city. Lehigh Permanente Cement was honored as the Large Business of the Year by the Cupertino Chamber of Commerce in 2001-2002.  On October 5, 2011, the Lehigh Permanente Cement Plant was the site of a shooting in which a disgruntled employee named Shareef Allman shot and killed three people and wounded seven, including one person who was injured during the course of a carjacking by Allman after the shooting. Allman was shot dead by three deputies, two men and one woman (each with less than five years' time at the department), after he would not surrender and displayed a firearm in a threatening manner toward the deputies.     /ref>




According to the City's 2010 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,  City of Cupertino CAFR  the top employers in the city are:



The city seal of Cupertino from 1999 to 2007.
Cupertino was incorporated in 1955. The highest body in the city government is the City Council, made up of five members who serve overlapping, four-year terms. The council itself elects the mayor and vice-mayor for a term of one year. The city does not have its own charter. Instead, it is a General Law city, which follows provisions and requirements for cities established by the state of California.

Cupertino contracts with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Clara County Fire Department for public safety services. The Cupertino Library is part of the Santa Clara County Library System.

The city's symbol is a conquistador's morion. A sculpture of this helmet stands next to Cupertino City Hall, and several versions of the helmet have also been used as the city logo. The original sculpture was made in 1971 by John Augsburger of San Luis Obispo. A full-sized replica of the sculpture, made by Fred Subega was given to the city of Toyokawa, Japan as a gift to commemorate their tenth anniversary as sister cities. A smaller sculpture in the shape of the helmet in the 1999-2007 Cupertino city seal was also given to the city of Toyokawa as a twenty-fifth anniversary present.



In the state legislature Cupertino is located in the 11th Senate District, represented by Democrat Joe Simitian, and in the 22nd Assembly District, represented by Democrat Paul Fong. Federally, Cupertino is located in California's 15th congressional district, which has a Cook PVI of D+14    and is represented by Democrat Mike Honda.



The city is served by an interconnected road system. Two freeways, State Route 85 and Interstate 280, intersect in Cupertino, and like any typical middle-class California suburb, it also has multi-lane boulevards with landscaped medians and traffic lights at all major intersections. Streets are in good condition and nearly all have sidewalks. The few exceptions are in unincorporated pockets at the city's edges, which are maintained directly by Santa Clara County.

Gridlock traffic occurs at some main intersections during evening rush hour (5 p.m. to 7 p.m.), particularly at De Anza Boulevard and Interstate 280 because of freeway metering lights.

Cupertino has bike lanes on many of its boulevards, though due to the high volume of traffic bicyclists must exercise caution. Bicycle traffic is heavy usually around morning and noon times around DeAnza  college, helmets are compulsory for cyclists below the age of eighteen, but are always recommended. Patrol cars will not stop juvenile riders not wearing a helmet, but patrol cars will not hesitate to stop and warn bicyclists not following the Cupertino Bicycle laws. The VTA has several buses running through Cupertino at major arteries, and all buses have bike racks that can support up to two bikes. If there are already two bikes on the rack, it is up to the bus driver to decided whether the passenger can bring the bike aboard or not - usually the passenger is not allowed to if the bus is already full. Blinkers and safety reflectors are mandatory and recommended for night time riding, Cupertino's main streets are well lit, while a few older roads towards the Monta Vista High School area are a little dim requiring a higher level of awareness for bicyclists during night times.

Dedicated on April 30, 2009, Cupertino opened the Mary Avenue Bicycle Footbridge, the first cable-stay bicycle pedestrian bridge over a California freeway. This bridge connects the north and the south sections of the Stevens Creek Trail. The total cost of the bridge project was $14,800,000. " Mary Avenue Bicycle Footbridge Dedication,"City of Cupertino

The Union Pacific Railroad operates a branch line track up to the Lehigh Permanente Cement Plant from the mainline at San Jose Diridon Station. It is however strictly for the quarry and very little to no non-quarry traffic runs there.

There is no commuter rail or light rail service in the city. Caltrain commuter rail runs through the cities to the north and east, and the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)'s Mountain View - Winchester light rail line runs to Campbell, California to the south. Bus service is also provided by VTA, and the prospect of twenty-four hour bus service on Stevens Creek Boulevard is being studied. Though this corridor (line 23) is one of VTA's most heavily used routes, there is no express or limited-stop service that takes commuters into San Jose, and the quality of service is therefore considered to be relatively poor. Better service would most likely not be economical  because the population density of the area is relatively low due to the trend of the area toward independent houses and very small apartment blocks.

Cupertino is landlocked and, like most Bay Area cities, relies on the Port of Oakland for most oceangoing freight.

Passenger and cargo air transportation is available at San Jose International Airport in San Jose. The closest general aviation airport is in Palo Alto; it is known as Palo Alto Airport of Santa Clara County.

In addition, China Airlines operates bus services from Marina Food at 10122 Bandley Drive in Cupertino to San Francisco International Airport to feed its flight to Taipei, Taiwan. " South Bay- SFO Int'l Airport Bus Service," China Airlines
