Octoban



Octobans, also known as tube toms, are deep, small diameter, single-head tom-toms. Octobans were originally grouped in melodically-tuned sets of eight, hence the name, in reference to octave and from octo meaning "eight".

Part sets of two or four drums or an indivual drum or octo are common additions to a drum kit.

Complete and half sets of octobans are commonly mounted in clusters of four, in a square pattern. Mounts for four drums in a straight line, dual mounts for two drums, and individual mounts are all also reasonably common. In a drum kit, octobans are most commonly placed to the left of a right-handed drummer, above the hi-hats.



Octobans were introduced by Tama drums in 1978. They had 15 cm (6 inch) diameter drum shells, and range in length from 280 millimeters (11 inches) to 600 millimeters (23-1/2 inches). The different lengths of the cylinders give each drum its distinct tone.[1]

The term octoban has since become a genericized trademark used to refer to such sets of smaller diameter tube drums.[2]

Octoban drum shells from other manufacturers are of varying lengths, and made from materials like fiberglass, acrylic, aluminum, and wood. Some people build their own octobans out of PVC or similar commercial tubing.[7]
