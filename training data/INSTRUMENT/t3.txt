INSTRUMENT

Madal




The Madal (Nepali: ????), double-headed drum of Nepalese origin (of the Membranophone family), used mainly for rhythm-keeping in Nepalese folk music, is the most popular and widely used hand drum in Nepal.The Madal consists of a cylindrical body with a slight bulge at its center, closed on both ends (the sides are often referred to as "heads", one head is smaller than the other).

The madal has a strand that goes around the waist of the person playing it to hold it horizontally . Playing technique involves rhythmic struck one either ends(heads) with palm. The heads vibrate to produce sound when struck.

This typical Nepalese percussion instrument is the backbone of most of Nepali folk music. The well-known Nepali musician Ranjit Gazmer introduced this instrument to Bollywood music and has used it in many Bollywood songs such as 'Hum dono do premi duniya chhod chale', 'Kanchha re kanchhi re' and many others. There is also a madal drum from the ancient tribes of India.




The ancient name of Madal was Mardal (????? in Nepali).

Typically, a wooden log is carved so as to form a hollow cavity, called Ghar (???). The two opposite openings are covered with cow leather. The cow leather on either head also consists of a black inner concentric circle. This layer is made up of a black substance known as Khari (???), which is the powdered mixture of Kansh (????) and Kit (???). This black substance give the skin weight and cause the tone to reverberate like a low pitched bell.[2] The heads are not of the same size; the larger and the smaller heads are often refereed to as male and female respectively.[3] The madal's other feature are the strands that overlay the central body. These strands, also made up of cow leather, are used to tune the instrument.
