Badaga language

The Baduga language (Baduga: ??? ???? ,Tamil: ????? ????, Kannada: ??? ????) is a southern Dravidian language (Tamil–Kannada branch) spoken by approximately 400,000 people (the Badugas) in the Nilgiri Hills in Southern India.[1] It is known for its retroflex vowels. The word Badaga refers to the Baduga language as well as the Baduga community/tribe.




Baduga has five vowels /i e a o u/, all of which can be contrastively half and fully retroflexed. Only the most conservative dialects have the complete set of contrasts (that is contrasts of pharyngealized and retroflexed vowels).[2]

Note on transcriptions: rhoticity (e.g. [i?], [e?]) indicates half-retroflexion or pharyngealization; an underdot (e.g. [?], [?]) indicates full retroflexion.






Several attempts at constructing an orthography based on Tamil, English and Kannada. Tamil, because many Badugas are literate in Tamil; English, this is a popular second language taught in schools; and Kannada, as Baduga is very closely related to Kannada.
